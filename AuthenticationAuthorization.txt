Authentication-> lt decides who you are
Authorisation > It decides what you can do 

Ways of doing Authentication
--------------------------------
Basic Authentication / Password Authentication
----------------------------------------------
Simplest form of authentication
- Client is expected to pass Username and passwo rd for every
request
- Service if able to validate the authenticity of Username and
password, can return the response, else reject the response with
response code 401


Token based authentication
--------------------------
-User registers the same Way
-User logins with registered credentials. Login response returns
a access token as a return
- Now client instead of passing username/passwo rd every time, they
need to pass the access token which has an expiry team.
- JWT token is a standard token used days for token based
authentication

Advantages:
-----------------
1. Client credentials are not over exposed.
2. Access token are encrypted.
