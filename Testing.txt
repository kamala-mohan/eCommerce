Testing
it is quite important to test it before deploying on production.
Testing
------
1. Manual -> you run the application, provide some input and check
whether correct output is received or not.
2. Automated -> The application is tested by writing more code
that is solely res ponsible for testing your application.


1. Conventionally Testing Process
--------------------------------
1. Write the complete code.
2. Start Testing
3.Production deptoyment if things look OK



Challenges
-----------
1.Testing is added very kate to the cycle of development.
2.Last Minutes issues, might delay in the release because
re-development.
3.Comprised testing because of the rush of the release.




2. Test Driven development
----------------------------------

Write testing code before even you start developing the application
n then write the code to pass all the test cases for that project

This is known as Test driven development

-The developer first writes the test cases based on the requirements.
If you are building a calculator,
the developer will write the test cases that assert

-developer write only enf code to pass all the test cases.
-Once all the test cases are passes, the developer can perform 
code cleaning, removing some duplicate code and improving the
performance.


Advantages
------------
It builds ur confidence when it comes to coding as uk that the code
written so far is fine.

It helps u achieve 100% test coverage.

It improves productivity



Unit Testing
-------------
Testing framework ->
-Jest
Delightful js Testing framework with a focus on simplicity
It is maintained by Facebook
It is fast and minimum steps ro setup
